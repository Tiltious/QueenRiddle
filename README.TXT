USER INSTRUCTIONS:

The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. There are 92 solutions. The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century.

This app takes a chain of integers that each one represents the position of a Queen and desides if this chain is valid. If not, it returns the first threat  found and a simple chess board with placed queens. It is able to solve the puzzle for chessboards from 4 to 15 rows.
